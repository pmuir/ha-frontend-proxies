# Home Assistant Add-on: Uptime Kurma Proxy

⚠️ This addon does not contain Uptime Kurma ⚠️

This addon acts as a proxy to an external running Uptime Kurma instance. 
The sole purpose of this addon is to add a Uptime Kurma icon to the sidebar of Home Assistant which will open the frontend of an external running Uptime Kurma instance.

## Options

- `server` (required): this should be the local URL on which the Uptime Kurma frontend is running, e.g. `http://192.168.2.43:8080`. Make sure there is no trailing slash!
